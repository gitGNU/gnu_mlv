%description
The mlv library is a simplified multimedia libary.
The library permit to:
 - draw figures, text and boxed text,
 - display images,
 - plays musics,
 - get Keyboard and mouse event
 - get informations by input boxes
This tools is a simplified interface of the SDL libraries.
If you are not a beginner, we recommend you to use the 
SDL libraries (sdl, sdl-gfx, sdl-sound,sdl-ttf) instead of
the mlv library.
The mlv library can be compiled for Linux, Macintosh 
and windows.
This package provide the runtime binary needed by the
execution of program using the mlv library.

-   Add a path API to work with paths.
-   Lots of name uniformisations have been performed.
-   Suppresion of the anglicism evenement in the API. Only headers
-     have been modified. MLV_evenement.h become MLV_event.h.
-   Simplification of the family of MLV_draw_adapted_box functions.
- Examples :
-   Renumbering of the examples ( the numbers contain always 2 digits )
-   Add a new example explaining how to use the transparency in 
-     the MLV library.
-   Add the example 07_time.c who explain how to use time functions
-   Add the example 09_full_screen.c who explain how to use the 
-     fullscreen mode 
-   Add a new  example 09_library_informations explaining how to

-     approximations.
- Documentation :
-   The internet URL present in the file tp5graph.pdf has been
-     corrected.
-   A Contact paragraph has been added in the MLV Documentation.
-   An html api of the MLV library has been added in the documentation.
-     This api is generated automatically by doxygen.
-   Documetation explaining how to use MLV with Dev-c++ has been wrotten.
-   Documetation explaining how to install the MLV Library on Mac OS X has 
-     been wrotten.
-   Documetation explaining how to create installation package for Mac OS X
-     has been wrotten.

-   Add an animation framework.
- Path :
-   Add a path framework.
- Xml :
-   Add a xml framework.
- General :

-     return the version of the library.
-   The header are now compatible with C++ compilers.
-     User can now use the library in C++ projects.
- Image :
-   Correction of transparence bugs in some functions working
-     with images.
-   Add the support of several type of image (jpg, png, bmp, ...) 
-     Thanks to SDL_image.
-     To load that images, developper can use MLV_load_image.
